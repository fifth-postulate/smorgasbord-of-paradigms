# Origin
This workshop originated after an observation. Software development toots the
horn of chosing the right tool for the job. But all to often development is
jumped started by creating a project in their favorite, general purpose,
programming language.
Each problem is a challenge in modelling and design, followed by expressing the
model and the accompanying algorithms in code.

But what if your problem is already solved? When you need to sort a list, you
are not designing and implementing your own sorting algorithm.
It is not uncommon that "solved" problems get treated exactly this way.

It is the fascilitators opion that there is a _smorgasbord of paradigms_ that
allow the expression and solution of certain style of problems without the
need to model, design and expressing every minute detail in code.

It is that opinion that let to this workshop. We hope that besides stuffing
your toolbelt with useful an interesting tools, you also enjoy learning about
these wonderful paradigms.
